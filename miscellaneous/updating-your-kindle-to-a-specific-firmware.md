# Updating your Kindle to a specific Firmware

Info taken from original thread: [https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=338268](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=338268)

Amazon, at least as for now, has not deleted previous versions of their firmware files. So it is possible to just grab a link for yourself, edit the version number, then download the version you desired. This might be useful if you have had a Kindle laying around for a while with a dead battery and it's on a very old version of the firmware, or if you're trying to [downgrade your Kindle](downgrading-your-kindle-firmware.md).



1.  Choose your device from the list below, copy the URL displayed next to its nickname and replace 5.XX.X with your desired firmware version. Make sure that the firmware you chose is on the list of supported versions above! PW2 and KT2 don't have firmware above `5.12.2.2`, you won't be able to download them. PW5 starts at `5.14.1.1`, the KT5 starts at `5.15.1` and the Kindle Scribe starts at `5.16.1`.

2. Connect your kindle to your PC with an USB in USBMS mode and put the downloaded `update_kindle_*.bin` file to the top-level/root of the visible USB storage. (It's the same directory where the documents folder is.)\
   \

3. Unplug your USB, go to Settings on your Kindle, then from the top right menu, choose Update Your Kindle. Your kindle will restart and update to the new firmware version.
