# Set up a Hotfix

_Note that if you've used_ [_WatchThis_](../jailbreak-software/watchthis-5.12.2.2-5.13.4-5.14.2.md)_, this page will not apply to you as WatchThis has a special Hotfix package as part of the installation that cleans up the files and switches off the demo mode on the Kindle. Follow_ [_Installing KUAL/MRPI_](installing-kual-mrpi.md) _instead._



Installing a Hotfix is very easy, it's only a matter of:

1. Download "K5 JailBreak Hotfix" from [NiLuJe's snapshot thread](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=225030).
2. Drop the `Update_jailbreak_hotfix_1.16.N_install.bin` into your Kindle's visible root storage.
3. Go to `Settings` > `Update Your Kindle` and then let it do its thing.
   * In the case of it throwing an invalid update error, it means the hotfix package hasn't been updated for that version yet. In which case you'll just have to wait.

## Once you've installed the Hotfix, continue to [Installing KUAL/MRPI](installing-kual-mrpi.md).
