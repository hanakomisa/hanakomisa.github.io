# WIP: Serial (8th gen or older)

Note that this method will require you to solder to the serial pads on the Kindle's motherboard, so you should have some soldering experience and a good soldering iron/station.

You will also need a USB to serial adapter that can do 1.8v. Most adapters that are being sold out there are 3.3/5V so be mindful, or buy a 1.8V regulator then solder the output to VCC.

You shouldn't really use this method if you're not planning to tinker with your Kindle on the low level (eg: [Forcing the Kindle Voyage to run a newer firmware](../miscellaneous/forcing-kv-to-run-5.14+.md)), as [Popcorn](popcorn-kt2-kt3-pw2-pw3-kv.md) is much easier to use.

Despite what I said above, if you do need to unbrick a Kindle, a serial connection is especially helpful, and that will be covered on [this page](../contingency-plan/wip-unbrick-a-kindle-with-your-system-backup-using-serial-8th-gen-or-older.md).
