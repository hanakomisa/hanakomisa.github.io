# The Kindle Modding Guide (WIP)

### Hello!&#x20;

This page is an attempt by [me](https://github.com/hanakomisa) (Neon) to try and condense, then streamline the information found on [MobileRead Wiki](https://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki) and the [MobileRead Kindle Dev Forum](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=150) to hopefully make it more organized, and easier for newcomers to get into.&#x20;

As of current, this guide will only cover non-legacy devices such as the PW2/KT2 and newer.

Any older non-touch devices, or the KT1/PW1 will get its own guide at some point, as those are quite different in how they're jailbroken, etc.

This guide is always open to suggestions and improvements. For any inquiries, feel free to contact me through:

* Email: jsyreviews(at)gmail(dot)com
* Mastodon: [@neon@tech.lgbt](https://tech.lgbt/@neon)
* Telegram: @neonnight

As always, credits to the original authors, to which this guide would not be possible without their info.

## Once you're ready, feel free to start [here](broken-reference).
