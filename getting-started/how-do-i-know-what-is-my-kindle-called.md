# How do I know what is my Kindle called?

In this guide (and pretty much all of MobileRead) will be referring to the models by their nicknames (eg: `PW4` for the `Kindle Paperwhite (10th Generation)`).

_In this guide, when it mentions a device, assume that all variants are included unless specified otherwise. (eg: PW5 will include both PW5 and PW5SE, KOA3 will include KOA3W32C, KOA3G32JP, KOA3G32, KOA3W32 and so on.)_

To check the model you have and your serial number, go into `Settings` > `Device Options` > `Device Info`, a window will pop up showing what model your Kindle is, alongside other things including your serial number.

### To see what serial number corresponds with which Kindle model, go to the [MobileRead Wiki](https://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/Kindle\_Serial\_Numbers) to find out.

_I have chosen to not duplicate the S/N table here to not cause more fragmentation, and thus, more things to keep up to date._

## Once you've identified your Kindle, go to [Determining what options you can use to jailbreak](determining-the-method-to-use-for-jailbreaking.md).
